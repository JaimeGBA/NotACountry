# Not A Country - Digital Explorations

An interactive website exploring African cultural diversity through contemporary art, aligned with V.Y. Mudimbe's philosophy of cultural invention and decolonizing knowledge.

## About

This digital humanities project challenges Western perceptions of Africa as a monolithic entity by showcasing the rich cultural diversity across the continent through the work of five contemporary African artists. Each artist represents a different region and offers unique perspectives on identity, tradition, and modernity.
